==============

This repository contains my Data Science portfolio & projects. It consists of 
  * **mle_project:** A review & demonstration of the normal distribution and OLS linear regression implemented with MLE.
  
  * **loan_prediction_project:** An end-to-end project on data cleaning, visualization, and prediction. I briefly compare the results between Logistic Regression and Random Forest model for binary classification of loan defaults. This is a work in progress.
    * ToDo: Rework notebook to calculate ROC curves for both models. Tune the discrimination threshold to improve performance.
    * ToDo: Add zip codes as dummy features.
  
  * **sir_mom_strategy_project:** This is a project I worked on with Adam Reed @ UNC-Kenan Flagler. We backtested an equity trading strategy based on short interest and momentum. The code is admittedly goofily-written, but it works. Data withheld to save space.

  * **fama_french_etf_project:** These are some R programs I wrote to download & parse Size, Value, and Momentum equity factor data from Ken French's library, and regress these factors against the returns on a selection of ETFs. The goal of this was to find several ETFs that had high exposure to theses risk factors but still had reasonable fees. I used the results from this analysis to make investment decisions in my own portfolio.
