==============

This repository contains my Data Science portfolio & projects. It consists of 
  * **mle_project:** A review & demonstration of the normal distribution and OLS linear regression implemented with MLE.
  
  * **loan_prediction_project:** An end-to-end project on data cleaning, visualization, and prediction. I briefly compare the results between Logistic Regression and Random Forest model for binary classification of loan defaults. This is a work in progress.
    * ToDo: Rework notebook to calculate ROC curves for both models. Tune the discrimination threshold to improve performance.
    * ToDo: Add zip codes as dummy features.
  
  * **ML_Models:** This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks containing implementations of popular machine learning
  models using NumPy and other core libraries. This is for purely academic purposes.
