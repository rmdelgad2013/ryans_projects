# Machine Learning Algorithms
*by Ryan Delgado*

This project is a library of concise implementations of common supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The
purpose is to solidify and demonstrate my understanding of these models. My implementations are inspired by the scikit-learn
library, and are built from scratch using mostly NumPy. Each Jupyter Notebook includes
* Description of the ML model and where it is used best
* The algorithms for fitting & predicting
* Examples using datasets from the sklearn.datasets module

Algorithms implemented:
* K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
* Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
* Linear Regression (via Gradient Descent)
* Bagged Trees Classifier
