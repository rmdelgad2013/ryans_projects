This is some code I wrote to help me decide on which ETFs to invest it. From my undergraduate classes I learned that smaller companies (by market cap) outperform larger companies, "cheaper" (high B/M) companies outperform pricier ones, and stocks with recent price momentum continue to outperform stocks with ppor price momentum. 
Whether these trends are evidence of anomalies or are risk factors has been debated extensively in academic finance for decades. Regardless of what the answer is, portfolio exposed to these risk factors will tend to have both higher absolute & risk-adjusted long term returns.

This theory can be applied by finding funds (whether ETFs or mutual funds) that expose themselves to these dimensions, and investing in the funds that have high exposure to these return predictive signals. That's what this project does. I searched the internet for small cap, value, & momentum ETFs and created a list. I then wrote a script (**FamaFrenchMOM.R**) to download & parse the Fama French Factor (Market, Size, Value, Momentum) data from Ken French's library, and wrote another script (**ETFAnalysis.**R)to regress these factors against the daily returns of the ETFs. I examined the regression results, and attributes (risk profile, fees, etc.) of the ETFs
